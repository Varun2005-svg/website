  "summary": "The diff implements the complete frontend UI (REQ-10 through REQ-13) including parallel generation, skeleton loaders, PDF export via jsPDF CDN, .txt production plan download, cinematic dark theme, responsive layout, and animations. The backend Motoko actor (REQ-9) is not visible in the diff — no backend/main.mo or equivalent file is shown as added or modified.",

      "reason": "No backend/main.mo file appears in the diff (added or modified). The frontend hook useQueries.ts calls actor.generateScreenplay, actor.generateCharacterProfiles, and actor.generateProductionPlan, confirming the expected interface, but the actual Motoko implementation is absent from this diff.",
